### Contributions / participation

is always welcome, here @ github or via e-mail.

Note please the following

* Please read at least the [coding convention](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/Coding_Convention.md).
* One PR per feature or bug fix or improvement. Please do not mix issues.
* Document your PR, both in the PR and/or commit message and in the code.
* Please test your changes thoroughly as reliability is important for this project. You may want to check different servers with different settings.
* Travis runs automatically when anything is committed/PR'd. You should check any complains from Travis. Beforehand you can check with `prove -v`.
* If it's a new feature please consider writing a unit test for it. You can use e.g. `t/20_baseline_ipv4_http.t` as a template. The general documentation for [Test::More](https://perldoc.perl.org/Test/More.html) is a good start.
* If it's a new feature it would need to be documented in the appropriate section in `help()` and in `~/doc/testssl.1.md`

For questions just open an issue or feel free to send me an e-mail.

#### Patches via e-mail

Of course it is fine when you want to send in patches to use e-mail. For the address please grep for SWCONTACT in testssl.sh .
